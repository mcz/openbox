.PP 
obxctl is a tool that reads XML data from FILE, or STDIN if FILE isn't specified, and passes them on to openbox for execution.
.PP 
Internally, it sends an XEvent to the root window, that tells openbox to read from a named pipe located at $XDG_CACHE_HOME/openbox/$DISPLAY. Then it writes the contents of FILE (or STDIN) to the pipe.
