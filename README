    Hi, I'm mzc and this is my fork of openbox.

    The two main things I've done / am doing are:

    -Areo snap (in the tiling branch). There are still some imprecisions in
     the pointer location when unsnapping windows, but all in all it's pretty
     much done.
     For this some things in rc.xml are changed:

        -Two new Actions are added, "Tile" and "Untile".
         Tile take an argument "direction" which can be either one of the 8
         cardinal directions, wither in full (Northwest, South) or abbreviated
         (nw, s).
       -In the mouse section, a new setting was added, "screenEdgeAction".
        It can be set to None, Warp, or Snap. If not set, it defaults to Warp.
        screenEdgeWarpTime was renamed to screenEdgeActionTime since it applies
        to both Warping and Snapping.

    -obxctl (in the eponymous branch). This is a command line program that lets
     you execute actions openbox Actions form the command line, by piping them
     to obxctl or reading them from a file. The Syntax for the XML is:

        <obxctl>
          <action name="Something">
            OPTIONS
          </action>
          <action name="SomethingElse"/>
        </obxctl>
