    Hi, I'm mzc and this is my fork of openbox.

    The two main things I've done / am doing are:

    -Areo snap (in the tiling branch). There are still some imprecisions in
     the pointer location when unsnapping windows, but all in all it's pretty
     much done.

    -obxctl (in the eponymous branch). This is a command line program that lets
     you execute actions openbox Actions form the command line, by piping them
     to obxctl or reading them from a file. The Syntax for the XML is:

        <obxctl>
          <action name="Something">
            OPTIONS
          </action>
          <action name="SomethingElse"/>
        </obxctl>

     Or rather, that's the theory. The way openbox knows it s supposed to read
     from the fifo the XML is getting written to, it gets send an XEvent (just
     like the one that gets used with "openbox --reconfigure" etc., but with a
     data.l[0] of 4.
     For some reason though, this event just doesn't get processed.
